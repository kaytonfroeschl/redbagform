## About The Project

I have been actively developing an ongoing project for a charitable organization that I have been a part of for more than a decade. The main objective of the project is to create a comprehensive multi-page form that will enable potential sponsors to register their interest in sponsoring a child. This form has been designed to collect all necessary information about the sponsor, their preference for sponsoring children, and then review and submit the information to the server.

  

To ensure the authenticity of the data, I have implemented a system to check for duplicate and fraudulent entries. By request, I have included a feature that automatically sends an email to one of the volunteers of the charity with all the information submitted by the sponsor upon completion of the form.

# Getting Started 

  

How you can set up this project locally. Again, this is an ongoing project so certain elements might not be fully functional. I have removed the function to "submit" any actual data to the server. 

###	Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

In the project root directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

Then run:

### `npm start`
 
This runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
